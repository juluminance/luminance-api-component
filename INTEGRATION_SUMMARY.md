# Salesforce Data Mapper Integration Summary

## Overview
The `lumi-salesforce-data-mapper` functionality has been successfully integrated into the `luminance-api` component. This integration provides seamless mapping between Salesforce records and Luminance annotations.

## What Was Integrated

### 1. New Action: `mapSalesforceToLuminance`
- **Location**: `src/actions/salesforceMapper.ts`
- **Purpose**: Maps Salesforce record fields to Luminance annotations using field mappings
- **Inputs**:
  - `sfConnection`: Salesforce Connection
  - `luminanceConnection`: Luminance Connection
  - `recordId`: The ID of the Salesforce record to map
  - `objectType`: The Salesforce object type (e.g., 'Opportunity', 'Account')
  - `fieldMappings`: Field mappings data source

### 2. New Data Source: `salesforceFieldMappingExample`
- **Location**: `src/dataSources/salesforceFieldMapper.ts`
- **Purpose**: Provides a dynamic form for mapping Salesforce fields to Luminance annotation types
- **Inputs**:
  - `sfConnection`: Salesforce Connection
  - `luminanceConnection`: Luminance Connection
  - `salesforceObjects`: Comma-separated object names to map

### 3. Dependencies Added
- **jsforce**: `3.6.6` - Salesforce JavaScript API client
- **@types/jsforce**: `1.11.5` - TypeScript definitions for jsforce

## Key Features

### Dynamic Field Discovery
- Automatically discovers all accessible fields from specified Salesforce objects
- Filters out deprecated and hidden fields
- Includes commonly needed fields like Id, Name, CreatedDate, etc.
- Supports both standard and custom objects

### Smart Annotation Type Filtering
- Prioritizes annotation types with names starting with `sf_` or `SF_`
- Falls back to all annotation types if no filtered types are found
- Provides type information in the mapping interface

### Robust Error Handling
- Handles missing objects gracefully
- Provides specific error messages for common issues (INVALID_TYPE, INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS)
- Continues processing even if some objects fail

### Structured Data Mapping
- Uses JSON Forms for intuitive field mapping interface
- Preserves object context in field selections
- Maintains field type and custom field information

## Usage Example

### 1. Configure Field Mappings
Use the `salesforceFieldMappingExample` data source to create field mappings:
- Select Salesforce objects (e.g., "Account, Opportunity")
- Map Salesforce fields to Luminance annotation types
- Save the mapping configuration

### 2. Execute Mapping
Use the `mapSalesforceToLuminance` action to:
- Retrieve a Salesforce record by ID
- Apply the configured field mappings
- Create Luminance annotations with the mapped values
- Return detailed mapping results

```

### Build Status
- ✅ Builds successfully with webpack
- ✅ Component manifest generated successfully
- ✅ All new functionality included in manifest
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Dependencies installed and working

## Benefits

1. **Unified Component**: All Luminance functionality now available in a single component
2. **Simplified Deployment**: No need to manage separate components for Salesforce integration
3. **Consistent API**: Uses the same connection patterns as other Luminance actions
4. **Enhanced Usability**: Integrated field mapping interface within the main component
5. **Maintainability**: Single codebase for all Luminance-related functionality

## Next Steps

The integration is complete and ready for use. The component can be:
1. Published to Prismatic
2. Used in integrations immediately
3. Extended with additional Salesforce mapping features as needed

## Testing

To test the integration:
1. Build the component: `npm run build`
2. Generate manifest: `npm run generate:manifest:dev`
3. Verify new actions and data sources are included in the manifest
4. Test in Prismatic platform with actual Salesforce and Luminance connections
